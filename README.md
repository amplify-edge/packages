## Docs

Use the same structure as here for this repo, so its easy to publish and easy for others to use.

## IO

IO is GRPC to the embed golang layer running on the device.

See the embed repo.

Also we want it to be easy for others to use a Module and compose it how they want with their app.
Flutter does not have Modular Routing yet but the following does the same:
